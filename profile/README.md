## Project Information

AI enabled healthcare services during cross-border medical emergencies and regular patient services.

The ESCORT project is a dynamic and forward-thinking initiative dedicated to transforming how healthcare systems operate both in everyday settings and during emergencies, including cross-border crises. Building on the successes of the NO-FEAR project, ESCORT is all about ensuring that patients receive uninterrupted, high-quality care no matter what challenges may arise.

At its core, ESCORT tackles the big issues that can disrupt healthcare, such as designing effective policies, coordinating diverse teams of health professionals, and maintaining steady patient access. The project goes beyond the basics by focusing on optimizing resource use and harnessing cutting-edge technologies. With a consortium of healthcare leaders from ten countries, ESCORT brings a wealth of expertise in both emergency medicine and regular care to the table.

What sets ESCORT apart is its collaborative spirit. By partnering with patient advocacy groups, the project co-designs innovative digital health services that are truly patient-centric. It integrates the latest AI and IoT technologies to boost monitoring and treatment, making healthcare smarter and more responsive. ESCORT also takes a hands-on approach to training, using simulated case studies to equip health professionals with the skills they need to handle advanced medical solutions effectively.

Additionally, ESCORT delivers evidence-based recommendations to strengthen EU health systems, ensuring they are resilient and ready to face any situation. Through these combined efforts, ESCORT aims to build a robust, adaptable healthcare framework that provides exceptional care in every scenario, proving that even in the face of adversity, high-quality healthcare can prevail.
